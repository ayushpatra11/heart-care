    heading:  "Shortness of breath (also called dyspnea)",
    reason: "Blood backs up in the pulmonary veins (the vessels that return blood from the lungs to the heart) because the heart can't keep up with the supply. This causes fluid to leak into the lungs."
},
{
    heading: "Persistent coughing or wheezing",
    reason: "Fluid builds up in the lungs (see above)."
},
{
    heading: "Buildup of excess fluid in body tissues (edema",
    reason: "As blood flow out of the heart slows, blood returning to the heart through the veins backs up, causing fluid to build up in the tissues. The kidneys are less able to dispose of sodium and water, also causing fluid retention in the tissues."
},
{
    heading: "Tiredness, fatigue",
    reason: "The heart can't pump enough blood to meet the needs of body tissues. The body diverts blood away from less vital organs, particularly muscles in the limbs, and sends it to the heart and brain"
},
{
    heading: "Lack of appetite, nausea",
    reason: "The digestive system receives less blood, causing problems with digestion."
},
{
    heading: "Confusion, impaired thinking",
    reason: "Changing levels of certain substances in the blood, such as sodium, can cause confusion."
},
{
    heading: "Increased heart rate",
    reason: "To make up for the loss in pumping capacity, the heart beats faster."
